YOUR MEASUREMENTS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>BODY FAT</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Body fat percentage (BFP) of a human or
other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass,
multiplied by 100; body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat.
Essential is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions. Body fat is
essential for maintaining body temperature, cushioning joints and protecting
internal organs. Weight alone doesn't give a clear idea of good health because
it combines both body fat and lean body mass or muscle. Carrying too much fat
is a condition called obesity, and reasons for many serious medical conditions
like heart disease, diabetes, even certain forms of cancer. In fact, at least
half the chronic diseases are caused by obesity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>VISCERAL FAT</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Visceral fat is body fat that is stored
within the abdominal cavity and is therefore stored around a number of
important internal organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines. Even if
your weight and body fat remain constant, as you get older the distribution of
fat changes and is more likely to shift to the abdominal area. Ensuring you
have a healthy level of visceral fat directly reduces the risk of certain
diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure and may delay the onset of
type 2 diabetes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Subcutaneous Fat</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Subcutaneous fat is the jiggly fat visible
just under the skin. Subcutaneous fat is normally harmless and may even protect
against some diseases. Visceral fat is fat that surrounds the organs. Though it
is not visible from the outside, it is associated with numerous diseases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It is possible to lose both subcutaneous
and visceral fat. While subcutaneous fat loss might be the goal for people who
want to fit into smaller clothes, losing visceral fat improves health.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>MUSCLE MASS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The predicted weight of muscle in your
body. Muscle mass includes the skeletal muscles, smooth muscles such as cardiac
and digestive muscles and the water contained in these muscles. Muscles act as
an engine in consuming energy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As your muscle mass increases, the rate at
which you burn energy (calories) increases which accelerates your basal
metabolic rate (BMR) and helps you reduce excess body fat levels and lose
weight in a healthy way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Bone Mass</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A measure of the amount of minerals (mostly
calcium and phosphorous) contained in a certain volume of bone. Bone mass
measurements are used to diagnose osteoporosis (a condition marked by decreased
bone mass), to see how well osteoporosis treatments are working, and to predict
how likely the bones are to break. Low bone mass can occur in patients treated
for cancer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>BODY WATER</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Body Water is the total amount of fluid in
the body expressed as a percentage of total weight. Water is an essential part
of staying healthy. Over half the body consists of water. It regulates body
temperature and helps eliminate waste. You lose water continuously through
urine, sweat and breathing, so it’s important to keep replacing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>BONE MASS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The predicted weight of bone mineral in
your body. While your bone mass is unlikely to undergo noticeable changes in
the short term, it’s important to maintain healthy bones by having a balanced
diet rich in calcium and by doing plenty of weight-bearing exercise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img class="responsive" width=624
height=317 id="Picture 3" src="image003.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>1 pound (lb) = 0.45359237 kilograms (kg).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The daily minimum level of energy or
calories your body requires when at rest (including sleeping) in order to
function effectively. Increasing muscle mass will speed up your basal metabolic
rate (BMR). A person with a high BMR burns more calories at rest than a person
with a low BMR. About 70% of calories consumed every day are used for your
basal metabolism. Increasing your muscle mass helps raise your BMR, which
increases the number of calories you burn and helps to decrease body fat
levels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>METABOLIC AGE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Compares your BMR to an average for your
age group.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This is calculated by comparing your basal
metabolic rate (BMR) to the BMR average of your chronological age group. If
your metabolic age is higher than your actual age, it’s an indication that you
need to improve your metabolic rate. Increased exercise will build healthy
muscle tissue, which in turn will improve your metabolic age. Stay on track by
monitoring regularly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>BODY MASS INDEX</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A standardized ratio of weight to height,
used as a general indicator of health.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Your BMI can be calculated by dividing your
weight (in kilograms) by the square of your height (in meters). BMI is a good
general indicator for population studies but has serious limitation when
assessing on an individual level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Metabolic Age</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Protein</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A molecule made up of amino acids. Proteins
are needed for the body to function properly. They are the basis of body
structures, such as skin and hair, and of other substances such as enzymes,
cytokines, and antibodies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img class="responsive" width=600
height=332 id="Picture 4" src="image004.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Cardiac Index</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Cardiac index (CI) is a haemodynamic
parameter that relates the cardiac output (CO) from left ventricle in one
minute to body surface area (BSA), thus relating heart performance to the size
of the individual. The unit of measurement is litres per minute per square
metre (L/min/m2).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The normal range of cardiac index at rest
is 2.6–4.2 L/min/m2.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Skeletal Muscle</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Skeletal muscle, also called voluntary
muscle, in vertebrates, most common of the three types of muscle in the body.
Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tendons, and they produce all the
movements of body parts in relation to each other. Similar to cardiac muscle,
however, skeletal muscle is striated; its long, thin, multinucleated fibres are
crossed with a regular pattern of fine red and white lines, giving the muscle a
distinctive appearance. Skeletal muscle fibres are bound together by connective
tissue and communicate with nerves and blood vessels</span></p>
